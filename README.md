# JetsonNano_DT_SPI + CANBUS (mcp2515)

fork to add support for this pican2 board:
http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican2-canbus-board-for-raspberry-pi-23-p-1475.html

After boot, you still have to configure can interface:
```sudo modprobe can
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000
```

The interuppt pin is wired to spi1, so that is disabled.
/dev/spidev0.1 is enabled also.

First, download this repository into your Ubuntu PC (not your Jetson Nano).
